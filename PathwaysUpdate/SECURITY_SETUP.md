# Security Setup Guide

## 🔐 Important Security Notice

Your database credentials were exposed in the GitHub repository. This has been fixed, but you need to take immediate action to secure your environment.

## 🚨 Immediate Actions Required

### 1. Rotate Your Database Credentials
Since your credentials were exposed, you should immediately:
- Change your Google Cloud SQL database password
- Update your database user credentials
- Consider creating a new database user with limited permissions

### 2. Set Up Environment Variables
The application now uses environment variables for sensitive data instead of config files.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions

### Option 1: Use the Setup Script (Recommended)
```bash
cd PathwaysUpdate
python setup_environment.py
```

This interactive script will:
- Help you migrate from the old config file
- Create a secure `.env` file
- Test your database connection
- Remove the old config file with exposed credentials

### Option 2: Manual Setup
1. Create a `.env` file in the `PathwaysUpdate` directory:
```bash
cd PathwaysUpdate
touch .env
```

2. Add your credentials to the `.env` file:
```env
# Cloud SQL Database Configuration
CLOUD_SQL_INSTANCE_NAME=your-instance-name
CLOUD_SQL_DATABASE_NAME=your-database-name
CLOUD_SQL_USER=your-username
CLOUD_SQL_PASSWORD=your-new-password
CLOUD_SQL_HOST=your-host-ip
CLOUD_SQL_PORT=3306

# PetPoint Credentials (optional)
PETPOINT_SHELTER_ID=your-shelter-id
PETPOINT_USERNAME=your-username
PETPOINT_PASSWORD=your-password
```

### Option 3: Streamlit Cloud Deployment
For Streamlit Cloud deployment, set these as secrets in your Streamlit Cloud dashboard:

1. Go to your app settings in Streamlit Cloud
2. Navigate to "Secrets"
3. Add each environment variable as a secret

## 🔒 Security Features

- ✅ `.env` file is protected by `.gitignore`
- ✅ `cloud_config.json` is now ignored by git
- ✅ All sensitive data moved to environment variables
- ✅ Setup script helps with secure migration
- ✅ Connection testing included

## 🧪 Testing Your Setup

After setting up your environment variables, test the connection:

```bash
cd PathwaysUpdate
python setup_environment.py
```

Or test manually:
```bash
cd PathwaysUpdate
python -c "
import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv
load_dotenv()
import pymysql
conn = pymysql.connect(
    host=os.getenv('CLOUD_SQL_HOST'),
    port=int(os.getenv('CLOUD_SQL_PORT', '3306')),
    user=os.getenv('CLOUD_SQL_USER'),
    password=os.getenv('CLOUD_SQL_PASSWORD'),
    database=os.getenv('CLOUD_SQL_DATABASE_NAME')
)
print('✅ Connection successful!')
conn.close()
"
```

## 🚫 What NOT to Do

- ❌ Never commit `.env` files to git
- ❌ Never commit `cloud_config.json` with real credentials
- ❌ Never share credentials in code comments
- ❌ Never use the old credentials that were exposed

## 📞 Support

If you need help with the setup or encounter issues:
1. Check that all environment variables are set correctly
2. Verify your database credentials are correct
3. Ensure your IP is authorized in Google Cloud SQL
4. Test the connection using the setup script

## 🔄 Migration from Old Config

If you have the old `cloud_config.json` file with real credentials:
1. Run `python setup_environment.py`
2. The script will help you migrate to environment variables
3. The old config file will be automatically removed
4. Your new `.env` file will be created securely
