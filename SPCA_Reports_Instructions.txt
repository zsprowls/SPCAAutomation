Before Running:
1. Make sure you have the latest files in the "__Load Files Go Here__" folder:
   - AnimalInventory.csv
   - StageReview.csv  
   - FosterCurrent.csv
   - AnimalOutcome.csv

   - Reads AnimalInventory.csv and StageReview.csv
   - Filters for animals on "Hold" status
   - Creates clear.csv with animals that need attention

2. Morning Email Report (MorningEmail/morning_email.py):
   - Reads multiple CSV files from "__Load Files Go Here__"
   - Generates a comprehensive morning report
   - Creates morning_email.docx
