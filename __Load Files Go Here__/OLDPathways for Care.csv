2/4 - was made BMOD due to reactivity and aggressive behaviors towards other dogs. Had dog test with fake dog and he attacked the face/neck and would not release. Placed on meds to see if that helps decrease reactivity. 
2/18 - doing much better on behavior meds, staff able to better redirect when he sees another dog. Went into behavior foster yesterday, doing well. 
3/3 - had a seizure while in foster and was turned away at e-clinic. BW is normal but Doc thinks it may be due to behavior meds, so he is no longer on them. Reactivity is an issue. Will try sertraline and clonidine combo.
