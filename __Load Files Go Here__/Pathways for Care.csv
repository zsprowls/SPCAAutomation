"Wishbone","57230680","Dog","Dog E","11/13/2024","181.0","Yes","In Progress","Yes","1/7 - available, reduced adoption fee due to age and LOS on 12/27, single dog only
2/4 - was made BMOD due to reactivity and aggressive behaviors towards other dogs. Had dog test with fake dog and he attacked the face/neck and would not release. Placed on meds to see if that helps decrease reactivity. 
2/18 - doing much better on behavior meds, staff able to better redirect when he sees another dog. Went into behavior foster yesterday, doing well. 
3/3 - had a seizure while in foster and was turned away at e-clinic. BW is normal but Doc thinks it may be due to behavior meds, so he is no longer on them. Reactivity is an issue. Will try sertraline and clonidine combo.
3/18 - available for adoption, is doing well on behavior meds. Charged fence while in play yard and staff was then able to redirect.  Place on Bissell Board, will feature again, waive adoption fee. 
4/1 - no change, behavior team is concerned with long term stay and barriers with adoption and overall candidacy, plan? Will try foster again.

5/13 - likely had another seizure and was on doc-hold, cleared and now available again. Trying to transfer to Lollypop"
